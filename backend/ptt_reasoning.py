ASSESSMENT CONTEXT:
Goal: {goal}
Target: {target}
Constraints: {json.dumps(constraints, indent=2)}

{tool_info}

TASK:
Analyze this goal and determine what structure and initial tasks are needed to accomplish it efficiently. 

DO NOT assume any predefined phases or structure. Instead:
1. Analyze what the goal actually requires
2. Determine if you need phases/categories or if direct tasks are better
3. Create an appropriate initial structure
4. Define specific actionable tasks to start with
5. use wordlist path as {WORDLIST_PATH} for any tool argument if required

Consider:
- What does this specific goal require?
- What's the minimal viable approach?
- How can available tools be leveraged?
- What structure makes sense for THIS goal?

IMPORTANT: When suggesting tool usage, be specific about commands and modules. For example:

Provide your analysis and initial structure in JSON format:

{{
    "analysis": "Your assessment of what this goal requires and approach",
    "structure": [
        {{
            "type": "phase/category/direct",
